### Summary

The video is about PDF-to-text and the challenges involved. The speaker, Napat, an AI/ML engineer at ArcFusion.ai who has experience working on PDF-to-Text conversion, discusses the difficulties of converting PDFs to text, especially scanned PDFs.

The speaker mentions that there are 3 main components to consider when working with PDFs: images, tables, and text.

- Images: Extracting images from digital PDFs is straightforward, but extracting images from scanned PDFs requires using object detection.
- Tables: Extracting tables can be done using libraries if the tables have borders around each cell. Extracting tables without borders is more challenging.
- Text: Text extraction is the most important part. The speaker mentions that there are challenges with accuracy, especially when dealing with scanned PDFs, which needed OCR.
